# Folklore

League of Legends chat service library for iOS and OS X.

## Installation

Add the following to your [`Podfile`](http://docs.cocoapods.org/podfile.html)
and then run `pod install`

```ruby
pod 'Folklore'
```

Don't forget to `#import <Folklore/Folklore.h>`.

## Usage

### Establishing a connection

```objc
- (void)didTapConnectButton:(id)sender {
    _folklore = [[Folklore alloc] initWithServerRegion:LoLServerRegionNorthAmerica];
    [_folklore setDelegate:self];
    [_folklore connectWithUsername:@"jdoe"
                          password:@"secret123"];
}

#pragma mark - FolkloreDelegate Protocol

- (void)folkloreDidConnect:(Folklore *)folklore {
    NSLog(@"Connection successful");
}

- (void)folkloreConnection:(Folklore *)folklore didFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
    NSLog(@"Connection failed with error: %@", error);
}
```

### Friend list

Folklore does not maintain a list of friends. It is obtained by this delegate method for the implementation to manage. By default every friend object in the list will be offline/unavailable until a friend update is received for each online friends,  individually.

```objc
#pragma mark - FolkloreDelegate Protocol

- (void)folklore:(Folklore *)folklore didReceiveFriends:(NSArray *)friends {
    for (FolkloreFriend *friend in friends) {
        NSLog(@"\t%@", friend.name);
    }
}
```

### Friend update

```objc
#pragma mark - FolkloreDelegate Protocol

- (void)folklore:(Folklore *)folklore didReceiveFriendUpdate:(FolkloreFriend *)friend {
    NSLog(@"%@", friend);
}
```

### Sending and receiving messages

```objc
// `_friends` is a NSArray of FolkloreFriend objects, obtained during a friend list update.
[_folklore sendMessage:@"Welcome to Summoner's Rift!" toFriend:_friends[index]];

#pragma mark - FolkloreDelegate Protocol

- (void)folklore:(Folklore *)folklore didReceiveMessage:(NSString *)message fromfriend:(FolkloreFriend *)friend {
    NSLog(@"[%@] %@", friend.name, message);
}
```
